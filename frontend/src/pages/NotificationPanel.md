Usage notes:
- The bell icon in Dashboard header now shows a badge with unread count.
- Click the bell to open a dropdown listing recent notifications (latest 10).
- Clicking a notification marks it as read and decrements the badge.
- Polling every 20s keeps the list up to date. You can later switch to websockets.
